# ai-visualization
This repository is for my projects on visualizing AI models
(the README is a work in progress)

People who were imporant for this to be made:
* Alfredo Canziani (NYU, @alfcnz) - Initial idea from listening to his lectures and important knowledge
* vcubingx (YouTube) - Visuals from his video series on visualizing neural networks
